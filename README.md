# Multi-Directory-Search
This is a python code that uses the OS.WALK function to read through multiple directories in search of given key words. This code was tested the Enron dataset which contained more than a half million emails contained in hundreds of directories and sub-directories. Here i am searching for the sender and reciever of each email by using the keywords 'TO:' and 'FROM:.'
